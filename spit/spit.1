.SH "OVERVIEW"
.sp
\fBspit\fP [GLOBAL OPTIONS] \-c \fIcommands\fP ... \-c \fIcommands\fP
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.sp
\fBh\fP
.RS 4
Displays a myriad of testing commands
.RE
.sp
\fBf device\fP
.RS 4
Specific a single block device (e.g. \-f /dev/ram0)
.RE
.sp
\fBF prefix\fP
.RS 4
The filesystem filename prefix for filesystem tests (e.g. \-F testprefix \-j 32). \fB\-F\fP is an alternative to \fB\-f\fP and conflicts with it. Choose \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-F prefix\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fBG size\fP
.RS 4
Limit the positions to a maximum of \fBsize\fP GB (e.g. \-G 32). Without a suffix the units are in GB. Optional suffixes include: GiB, TiB, TB, PiB, PB.
.RE
.sp
\fBI filename\fP
.RS 4
Specific a file that contains a list of device names (e.g. \-I devices.txt). The \fBdevices.txt\fP file contains one device per line. To process 200 block devices at once, create devices.txt with 200 lines. e.g. \fBspit \-I devices \-c rs1k1024\fP will start 200 threads, one per device, and run the same command on them. Note in this case the starting position is not specified so each drive will start at a random location. Adding \fBz\fP will start each job from position zero.
.RE
.sp
\fBB filename\fP
.RS 4
The benchmarking file that has the per second read/write speed and IOPs
.RE
.sp
\fBP filename\fP
.RS 4
All positions with their size and timing and read/write actions are output. This file can be used by \fBspitchecker\fP to verify the positions between run.s
.RE
.sp
\fBj N\fP
.RS 4
Multiply the number of commands (\fB\-c\fP) by N. (e.g. \-j 8). \fB\-c rs0j8\fP will create 8 threads, each performing random reads. Each thread will be seeded with a unique random value so the random positions will not be the same.
.RE
.sp
\fBt s\fP
.RS 4
Limit the execution to \fBs\fP seconds (e.g. \-t 30)
.RE
.sp
\fBT s\fP
.RS 4
Hard exit(\-1) execution if spit is still running after \fBs\fP seconds.
.RE
.sp
\fBM options\fP
.RS 4
Output MySQL options per test. (e.g. \-M iotype=write,opsize=64,iopattern=rand,qd=128,devicestate=burst,degraded=0,k=10,m=2,encryption=none,checksum=crc32c,cache=1,precondition=GI20000)
.RE
.sp
\fBN options\fP
.RS 4
Output MySQL options per machine/type. (e.g. \-N os=centos,version=1.2.59,machine=wow,blockdevice=lsiraid)
.RE
.sp
\fBO filename\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a list of raw devices, matched with the \fB\-f\fP option shows
device read/write amplification. (e.g. \-f /dev/md0 \-O underlyingdevices.txt)
.RE
.sp
\fBP filename\fP
.RS 4
Save position information to \fBfilename\fP. The positions file contains the device, offset, size, random seed, start time, end time, latency, and more.
.RE
.sp
\fBv\fP
.RS 4
Verify writes by reading and checking. The positions can also be written using the global \fBP filename\fP command, then verified with \fBspitchecker\fP
.RE
.SH "COMMAND OPTIONS"
.sp
A command is a single contiguous string. Spaces are ignored if the
entire string is quoted. An example of a command string may look like:
\fBspit\fP \-c \fBrk64P1000s3\fP \-f /dev/device
.sp
The command options are described below:
.sp
\fBr\fP
.RS 4
Performs reads
.RE
.sp
\fBw\fP
.RS 4
Performs writes
.RE
.sp
\fBm\fP
.RS 4
Double the number of test positions, and add a read operation to the position of any previous write operation. Since the number of positions is usually much more than the QD there is no in\-flight issue. \fBm\fP can be combined with reading/writing or anymix. (e.g. ws0m)
.RE
.sp
\fBpN\fP
.RS 4
Set the read/write ratio to \fBN\fP. (e.g. p0 is write only, p1 is read only, p0.75 is 75% reads)
.RE
.sp
\fBGlow\-high\fP
.RS 4
Limit the position range to \fBlow\fP to \fBhigh\fP GB. (e.g. G2\-3).
.RE
.sp
\fBG_\fP
.RS 4
The range can be specified with the syntax \fBG_\fP which will split the G ranges evenly between all threads (no thread contention). e.g. \fBspit \-f dev \-c rzs1j32\fP will create 32 threads, all accessing the same block device, all reading the same positions. To partition the LBA space between threads use the \fBG_\fP option, which will first divide the LBA range by the number of threads.
.RE
.sp
\fBkN\fP or \fBklowBS\-highBS\fP
.RS 4
Block size or \fIlowblocksize\fP to \fIhighblocksize\fP range. (e.g. k4\-128). The hypen as a range will pick a value between the low and high range, in multiples of a 4KiB block size. The range with a colon (e.g. k4\-128) will only pick values that are also powers of 2.
.RE
.sp
\fBn\fP
.RS 4
Use random positions with replacement
.RE
.sp
\fBN\fP
.RS 4
Add the maximum block size to all positions
.RE
.sp
\fBqN\fP
.RS 4
Queue depth
.RE
.sp
\fBJN\fP
.RS 4
Jumble/shuffle \fBN\fP values at a time. (e.g. s1J10 randomises each 10 values)
.RE
.sp
\fBjN\fP
.RS 4
Scales up the number of jobs. Similar to the global \fBj\fP command.
.RE
.sp
\fBRN\fP
.RS 4
Seed
.RE
.sp
\fBsN\fP
.RS 4
number of contiguous sequence regions. \fBs0\fP means random, \fBs1\fP means
a single linear stream, \fBs32\fP means 32 contigous stream.
.RE
.sp
\fBs0.x\fP
.RS 4
Between s0 (random) and s1 (linear stream) there is a range of s0.0 up to s1. The s0.1 will be lineared by with a probability of 0.1 the location will be randomised.
.RE
.sp
\fBsN\-maxSizeInKiB\fP
.RS 4
Specify the number of continuous sequence regions, include the maximum
continuous length in KiB. e.g. s32\-1024 makes 32 contiguous regions with a
maximum size of 1024 KiB (1 MiB).
.RE
.sp
\fBu\fP
.RS 4
Generate pairs of writes followed by reads with unique seeds. Combined with
multiple threads and G_ (LBA thread separation) and QD=1, this enables POSIX w/r testing.
.RE
.sp
\fBz\fP
.RS 4
Start sequential positions from block 0
.RE
.sp
\fBZn\fP
.RS 4
Start sequential positions from block \fBn\fP
.RE
.sp
\fBD\fP
.RS 4
Turn off O_DIRECT device access mode. e.g. required for ZFS and similar file systems.
.RE
.SS "Scale/position commands"
.sp
\fBPn\fP
.RS 4
Limit the number of positions to \fBn\fP
.RE
.sp
\fBxn\fP
.RS 4
Cover each of the LBA positions \fBn\fP times. e.g. \-c rs1x1 will cover the LBA range and will ignore the time duration commands.
.RE
.SS "Timing commands"
.sp
\fBBn\fP
.RS 4
Before the command starts, wait \fBn\fP seconds
.RE
.sp
\fBWn\fP
.RS 4
Wait for \fBn\fP seconds between iterations
.RE
.sp
\fBTn\fP
.RS 4
Limits the thread/command to \fBn\fP seconds
.RE
.sp
\fBXn\fP
.RS 4
Instead of time based, iterate until the positions have been processed
\fBn\fP times.
