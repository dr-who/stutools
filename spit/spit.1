.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Spit is a comprehensive tool designed for testing block devices and
file systems. It offers a robust suite of testing capabilities including
latency tests, speed tests, and multi\-threaded conflict resolution tests.
.sp
It\(cqs particularly useful for validating system performance and reliability,
with features specifically designed to test Non\-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)
actions, caches, read\-ahead and action ordering. This functionality helps in identifying and resolving
issues that might arise in custom block devices and file systems.
.sp
Spit also supports decoupling of writes from verification, allowing
system reboots in between, which is crucial for system resilience
testing.
.sp
This makes spit an indispensable tool for system administrators, developers,
and performance engineers looking to evaluate and improve system performance
and stability.

.RE
.SH "DEVICE(S)"
.sp
\fB\-f device\fP
.RS 4
Specific a single block device (e.g. \-f /dev/ram0). Multiple threads can divide up the LBA range using the \fBj\fP option. (e.g. \-f /dev/ram0 \-c rzs1j8). If the goal is for each thread to access the same range, using uppercase \fBJ\fP option. (e.g. \-f /dev/ram0 \-c rzs1j8 would create 8 threads accessing the same range).)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-F prefix\fP
.RS 4
The filesystem filename prefix for filesystem tests (e.g. to create 32 files, each 1GiB in size use \fB\-F testprefix \-G1 \-J 32\fP). \fB\-F\fP is an alternative to \fB\-f\fP and conflicts with it. Choose \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-F prefix\fP. Note that uppercase J is used with the \-F option. This is because lowercase j means divide the LBA range by the number of threads, which would only write 1/32th of the data into each file. The file sizes may look correct due to an initial fallocate(1), but the total IO performed would be incorrect.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-I filename\fP
.RS 4
Specific a file that contains a list of device names (e.g. \-I devices.txt). The \fBdevices.txt\fP file contains one device per line. To process 200 block devices at once, create devices.txt with 200 lines.
e.g. \fBspit \-I devices \-c rs1k1024\fP will start 200 threads, one per device, and run the same command on them. Note in this case the starting position is not specified so each drive will start at a random location. Adding \fBz\fP will start each job from position zero.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-O filename\fP
.RS 4

device read/write amplification. e.g. \fBspit \-f /dev/md0 \-O underlyingdevices.txt\fP
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"

.RE
.sp
\fB\-d n\fP
.RS 4
Dump the first \fBn\fP positions to understand the IO profile.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-G size\fP
.RS 4
Limit the positions to a maximum of \fBsize\fP, using a default unit of GiB (e.g. \-G 32 means 32 GiB). Without a suffix the units are in GB. Optional suffixes include: GiB, GB, TiB, TB, PiB, PB. It is also possible to use the string \f(CRper\fP to represent a percentage.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-G start\-end\fP
.RS 4
Using a hyphen, the start/end positions of the block device can be specified. e.g. \f(CR\-G 1\-10\fP which is the [1 GiB, 10GiB) range. The range can also be specified as a percentage of the size of the smallest block device. e.g. \f(CR\-G 5per\-10per\fP. The percent sign is tricky on the command line, so we use this odd syntax.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-B filename\fP
.RS 4
The benchmarking file that records the regular console output to the benchmark file. The format is described in the second below. To get more fine grained results decrease the \fB\-s time\fP option.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P filename\fP
.RS 4
All positions with their size and timing and read/write actions are output. This file can be used by \fBspitchecker\fP to verify the positions between run. Overlapping write actions that overlap in position are filtered to keep the most recent action.  The positions file can be later verified using the \fBspitchecker(1)\fP program. If \fB\-P \-\fP is used instead of a filename, the positions will be stream to stdout (without overlap filtering) so verification may not be possible if writes overlap.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s time\fP
.RS 4
Specify the time between regular output. The default is \fB\-s 1\fP, which is one output line per second. \fB\-s 0.01\fP will output every 1/100th of a second. \fB\-s 0\fP will start off fast and slow time over time.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t s\fP
.RS 4
Limit the execution to \fBs\fP seconds (e.g. \-t 30)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-E\fP
.RS 4
Ignore errors, by setting exitOnError to no.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T s\fP
.RS 4
Hard exit(\-1) execution if no I/O is received within \fBs\fP seconds.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-L GiB\fP
.RS 4
Specify the amount of RAM to use for the position information. \f(CRspit\fP stores information about each position, so RAM scales up with the number of positions. Less RAM can be used by having larger block sizes. More positions can be obtained by using more RAM and/or larger block sizes. Without a suffix the default unit will be in GiB. Memory units of K/M/G can be used along with \f(CRo\fP which represents objects. e.g. \f(CR\-L 1000o\fP is only enough RAM for 1,000 position objects.
