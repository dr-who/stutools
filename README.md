      # spit -f /dev/sdk -rs0  

## Man page

      man -l spit/spit.1

## Write tests

      spit -f device -c wk64        # test seq writes 64KiB, starting a random location

      spit -f device -c wk64z       # test seq writes 64KiB, starting from block 0.

      spit -f device -c wk64s0      # random writes 64KiB

      spit -f device -c wk64s0j64   # random writes 64KiB, using 64 threads with overlapping ranges

      spit -f device -c wk64s0j64G_ # random writes 64KiB, using 64 threads, non overlapping ranges

      spit -f device -c wk64s0j64G10-20 # random writes 64KiB, 64t, overlapping LBA range [10-20] GB

      spit -f device -c wk64s0j64G10_20 # random writes 64KiB, 64t, non-overlapping LBA range [10-20] GB
                                     note the underscore range delimits non-overlapping ranges.

      spit -f device -c wk64s0j32 -v # add -v to verify the writes

      spit -f /dev/md0 -c ... -O rawdevices.txt  # perform actions on a meta device and show amplification

## Dump out the commands

      spit -f .... -c ... -d 100     # dumps out the first 100 commands, to see what's happening

## IOPS latency

      spit -f device -c wk64s0S1000q1 -P pos.txt   # random write, 64K, target 1,000 IOPS with qd=1. Display latency

               # all timing information is in the file specified with -P

## Write/read alternating

      spit -f device -c 'w s1 k1024 z m1'        # write then read back the same block, alternating 1:1

      spit -f device -c 'w s1 k1024 z m100'      # write 1MiB blocks sequentially, every 100 writes read the last 100


## TRIM/Discard tests

      spit -f device -c ts0 -G10    # perform random trims 

      spit -f device -c wx5 -G10 -T # write 10GiB at a time, trimming the LBA before each iteration ('T'), repeat 5 times.

## Read and more complex tests

      spit -f device -c rs0         # random reads 4KiB

      spit -f device -c rs0j64      # random reads 4KiB, 64 threads

      spit -f device -c rs0j64G_    # random reads 4KiB, 64 threads, non-overlapping LBA range

      spit -f device -c rs0j2G_ -d 10 # dump the first 10 positions in each thread

      spit -f device -c wk64j3 -c rk64j2    # three writers, two reader threads

      spit -f device -c wk4-128j3 -P positions.txt  # variable block range, three overlapping
                                    range, positions written out

      spitchecker positions.txt     # verify the previous writes, say after a reboot.
                                    Same code as the -v verification option.

      spit -f device -c wk64s0G10-20j4 -c rk4-8G20-100j64   # two ranges [10-20]
                                    and [20-100] GB, varying threads and I/O type.

      spit -f device -c wk4P1000000 # write to only 1,000,000 positions for cache testing

      spit -f device -c wk2048x1    # x1 means write the LBA size once (or a Glow-high range),
                                    instead of being time limited.

## Multiple input files and utilization

      spit -I listofdevices.txt -c w  # will read a list of devices from the file.

      spit -f device -c ... -O listofdevices.txt  # will display the r/w/IO operations on the devices.
                                    This is used to see meta-device amplification and phy IO.

## Limits

      The limits can be per LBA multiple using the 'x' option. e.g. x1 is the LBA size.

      Or by position using the 'X' option. X1 is the number of positions.

      Or by time using the local 'T' (time) option. T2 is two seconds. The xXT options can't be combined.

## NUMA binding

      By default the spit threads are distributed evenly between the NUMA nodes. To disable
      NUMA pinning use the -u option. For example with j51 (51 threads) spit may output:

      *info* NUMA[0] 26 pinned on 24 hardware threads, NUMA[1] 25 pinned on 24 hardware threads,

      To bind all threads to NUMA node 0 use -U 0. The output will then be:

      *info* NUMA[0] 51 pinned on 24 hardware threads, NUMA[1] 0 pinned on 24 hardware threads,

      The -U format allows a list (-U 1,2) and a range (-U 0-3,5).

## File system tests

      The -f (lowercase) filename will create a SINGLE file with that name. Capital -F prefix will
      create MULTIPLE files, one per thread.

      spit -f filename -G 10 -c wk4-8s0  # create a 10 GiB file and perform random variable length
                                   writes on the file.        

      spit -F /mnt/prefix -G 10 -c wk64j128  # In 128 threads, create a file per thread, 10 GB in size,
      	                           run for the default 10 seconds.

      spit -F /mnt/prefix -G 10 -c wk64j128x1  # In 128 threads, create a file per thread, 10 GB in size,
                                   write each file once. e.g. create 128 x 10 G files.


## SNIA Common tests
      spit -f device -p G -c wk64    # precondition random 4k writes, test seq writes 64KiB

      spit -f device -p G -c rs0     # precondition random 4k writes, test rand reads 4KiB

      spit -f device -p G -c mP100000 # precondition, then R/W mix on 100,000 positions

## Usage

      Usage:
       spit [-f device] [-c string] [-c string] ... [-c string]

      Create positions:
       spit -f dev -c rs0            # defaults to use RAM and generate unique positions. MIN(15GB,freeRAM/2)
       spit -f dev -c rs1P100z       # the first 100 positions in a device, starting from zero
       spit -f dev -c rs1P100        # the first 100 positions in a device, offset by a random amount
       spit -f dev -c rs0P100        # the first 100 positions in a device, randomised
       spit -f dev -c rs1P+100z      # 100 positions equally spaced across the array, starting from zero
       spit -f dev -c rs1P+100       # 100 positions equally spaced across the array, offset by a random amount
       spit -f dev -c rs0P+100       # 100 positions equally spaced, randomised
       spit -f dev -c rs1P-100       # subsample with replacement, 100 positions randomly distributed over the array
       spit -f dev -c rs0P-100       # effectively the same as above with s1. But re-randomised.
       spit -f dev -c rs1P.100z      # 100 equally spaced, alternating start,end,s+1,e-1... centre
       spit -f dev -c rs1P.100       # effectively the same as above with s1 but with random offset
       spit -f dev -c rs0 -L20       # Use 20GiB of RAM to generate more unique positions
       spit -f dev -c rs0j2G_        # Make two threads, but first split the LBA range into two.

      Copying regions:
       spit -f dev -c c              # will copy from a region to a destination 1/2 the LBA away, 4 KiB blocks
       spit -f dev -c ck64           # will copy using 64 KiB blocks
       spit -f dev -c ck64j4G_       # Divides the space into 4 regions, runs 4 threads performing local copies per region
       spit -f dev -c ckz64-2048      # Will perform 2 MiB worth of 64 KiB reads, then a single 2 MiB write, starting from 0

      Varying executions: (time, position and LBA controls)
       spit -f dev -c rs0            # run for 10 seconds by default
       spit -f dev -c rs0 -t10       # run for 10 seconds
       spit -f dev -c rs0 -t-1       # run for ever
       spit -f dev -c rs0x1          # cover the entire LBA one time
       spit -f dev -c rs0x2          # cover the entire LBA two times
       spit -f dev -c rs0P100x1      # perform a LBA worth of those first 100 positions
       spit -f dev -c rs0P100x3      # perform 3xLBA worth of those first 100 positions
       spit -f dev -c rs0P2000X1     # execute the 2,000 IO operations
       spit -f dev -c rs0P2000X2     # execute the 2,000 IO operations, twice
       spit ..-t 60 -c ws1zM2P1000=  # = alternates r/w per pass. Write 1000, then read 1000, continue for 60s

      Sequential/random/striping:
       spit -f dev -c s1z            # sequential, one linear region, starting from zero
       spit -f dev -c s1             # sequential, one linear region, randomly offset
       spit -f dev -c s0             # Not sequential, i.e. random
       spit -f dev -c s2             # Two sequential regions. Divided the thread/region into two
       spit -f dev -c s9             # Nine sequential regions. Divided the thread/region into nine...
       spit -f dev -c s-1z           # Reverse sequential starting from the end of the array
       spit -f dev -c s-1            # Reverse sequential, randomly offset
       spit -f dev -c s-2            # Two sequential regions, reversed, randomly offset

      Between linear and random:
       spit ... s-1                  # monotonically decreasing
       spit ... s0                   # random
       spit ... s0.05                # Almost entirely random with a few monotonically increasing positions
       spit ... s0.95-20             # With a probability of 0.05 swap with a position +/- 20 positions
       spit ... s0.98                # With a probability of 0.02 swap with any other position
       spit ... s1                   # monotonically increasing

      Positions/latencies:
       spit -P filename              # dump positions to filename
                                     # file contains device, position, size, timing, latency per sample, median latency
       spit -P -                     # dump positions to (stdout) and stream raw IOs without collapsing
                                     # column 2 (byte offset), 6 (operation), 7 (size)
                                     # column 12/13 (start/fin time), column 14 (mean latency)
                                     # column 15 (#samples), 16 (median latency)
        ... -S positions             # read all the positions from 3 columns. position action and size

      LBA coverage: (using lowercase x)
       spit -c P10x1                 # write 10 positions until the entire device size is written
       spit -c P10x3                 # write 10 positions until the entire device size is written three times
       spit -c x5                    # writing the block device size 5 times, not time based

      Position coverage: (using capital X)
       spit -f ... -c P10X100        # multiply the number of positions by X, here it's 100, so 1,000 positions
       spit -f .... -c wns0X10       # writing the number of positions 10 times, not time based
       spit -c P10X1                 # write 10 positions
       spit -c P10000X100            # write the same 10,000 positions 100 times

      Complete coverage: (positions required, size of `LBAbytes / (RAMbytes / 64)`)
       spit -f ... -c ..C            # the 'C' command will check the complete LBA is covered, or exit(1)

      Displays: (-s 1 default, once per second)
       spit -s 0.1 -i 5              # display every 0.1 seconds, ignore first 5 GB

      Queue depth: (IO in flight)
       spit -f .... -c q128          # per job max queue depth (max inflight is 128, submit one at a time)
       spit -f .... -c q32-128       # set the min queue depth to 32, submit at most 32 IOs at a time, max 128
       spit -f .... -c q128-128      # set queue depth to fixed at 128 IOs in flight at all time. Uses less CPU.

      Speed targets: (IOPS target)
       spit ... -c ws1S1000q1        # Target 1000 IOPS, with QD=1
       spit -c ws1zk10001J2S1000     # Writing monotonically, but from alternating between two threads at 1 MB x 1000/s = 1 GB/s
       spit -F. -c ws1zx1j64S100q1 -G1 # creates files from .0001 to .0128, with IOPS targets
       spit ... -c ws1S100           # Targets slower IOPS, S100 targets 100 IOPS per thread, with default qd

      Writing/pausing:
       spit -f device -c W5          # do 5 seconds worth of IO then wait for 5 seconds
       spit -f device -c W0.1:4      # do 0.1 seconds worth of IO then wait for 4 seconds
       spit -f ... -c w -cW4rs0      # one thread seq write, one thread, run 4, wait 4 repeat
       spit -f ... -c ws1W2:1 -t60   # Alternate run for 2 seconds, wait for 1 second
       spit -f .. -c ws0S1           # Write a 4KiB block, randomly, 1 IO per second. The *slow* Loris

      NUMA control:
       spit -f -c ..j32 -u           # j32, but do not pin the threads to specific NUMA nodes
       spit -f -c ..j32 -U 0         # j32, pin all threads to  NUMA node 0
       spit -f -c ..j32 -U 0,1       # j32, split threads evenly between NUMA node 0 and 1
       spit -f -c ..j32 -U 0-2       # j32, split threads evenly between NUMA node 0, 1 and 2
       spit -f -c ..j32 -U 0,0,1     # j32, allocate threads using a 2:1 ratio between NUMA node 0 and 1

      See/dump the actions/positions:
       spit -f ... -c ... -d 10      # dump the first 10 positions/actions

      LBA ranges/partitioning:
       spit -f device -c r -G 1      # 0..1 GB device size
       spit -f device -c r -G 384MiB # -G without a range is GB. {M,G,T}[i*]B
       spit -f device -c r -G 100GB  # Support GB/GiB etc  spit -f device -c r -G 1-2    # Only perform actions in the 1-2 GB range
       spit -f device -c r -E -G 2-5 # if the -E argument is *before* -G, G values are percentages. e.g. 2%-5%
       spit -f device -c r -G 2-5 -E # NOTE: This doesn't work. -E must be before -G
       spit -c wx3 -G4 -T            # perform pre-DISCARD/TRIM operations before each round
       spit -c wx1G0-64k4zs1         # Write from [0,64) GiB, in 4KiB steps, sequentially 
       spit -c wx1G0-64k4zs1K20      # Write from [0,64) GiB, in 4KiB steps, writing 1 in 20. 
       spit -c wG_j4                 # The _ represents to divide the G value evenly between threads
       spit -c ws1G1-2 -c rs0G2-3    # Seq w in the 1-2 GB region, rand r in the 2-3 GB region
       spit -f ... -c P10G1-2        # The first 10 positions starting from 1GiB. It needs the lower range.
       spit -c ws1G5_10j16           # specify a low and high GiB range, to be evenly split by 16 threads (_)

      Logging for experiments:
       spit -f ... -l logfile        # will append the run results to 'logfile'. Works well with ./combo expansion
       spit -B bench -M ... -N ...   # See the man page for benchmarking tips

      Preconditioning:
       spit -p G100s1k64             # precondition job, sequential, 64 KiB blocks
       spit -p G -p Gs1              # precondition job, writing random, 100% LBA, then seq job

## Errors in block device

To create a 256 MiB block device:

 root# modprobe brd rd_nr=1 rd_size=$[256*1024]
 root# dmsetup create errdev0
 0 261144 linear /dev/ram0 0
 261144 5 error
 261149 263139 linear /dev/ram0 261149
 ^D
 
 # lsblk -b /dev/mapper/errdev0 
 NAME    MAJ:MIN RM      SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
 errdev0 253:0    0 268435456  0 dm

 root# ls -l /dev/mapper/errdev0 
 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Jun 27 14:03 /dev/mapper/errdev0 -> ../dm-6

To test the device:

 spit -f /dev/mapper/errdev0 -c wzs1 -P positions.txt

This displays a error at position 133705728 and doesn't output the
positions.txt file due to error and the positions.txt file will be 0
bytes. To ignore the I/O errors:

 spit -f /dev/mapper/errdev0 -c wzs1 -P positions.txt -E

The -E option continues and writes the positions.txt file. spitchecker can now verify the positions.

 spitchecker positions.txt

To attempt to see the block contents, you'd try this but it'll fail with I/O error.

 devcontents -f /dev/mapper/errdev0 -b 133705728

To remove the devices:

 root# dmsetup remove errdev0
 root# rmmod brd
